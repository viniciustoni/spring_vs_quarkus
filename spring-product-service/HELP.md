## GraalVM Native Support

This project has been configured to let you generate either a lightweight container or a native executable.
It is also possible to run your tests in a native image.

### Lightweight Container with Cloud Native Buildpacks
If you're already familiar with Spring Boot container images support, this is the easiest way to get started.
Docker should be installed and configured on your machine prior to creating the image.

To create the image, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Pnative
```

Then, you can run the app like any other container:

```
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 spring-product-service:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

### Executable with Native Build Tools
Use this option if you want to explore more options such as running your tests in a native image.
The GraalVM `native-image` compiler should be installed and configured on your machine.

NOTE: GraalVM 22.3+ is required.

To create the executable, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw native:compile -Pnative
```

Then, you can run the app as follows:
```
$ target/spring-product-service
```

You can also run your existing tests suite in a native image.
This is an efficient way to validate the compatibility of your application.

To run your existing tests in a native image, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw test -PnativeTest
```


### Testcontainers support

This project uses [Testcontainers at development time](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/3.3.5/reference/features/dev-services.html#features.dev-services.testcontainers).

Testcontainers has been configured to use the following Docker images:

* [`postgres:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)

Please review the tags of the used images and set them to the same as you're running in production.

### Maven Parent overrides

Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM.
While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent.
To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements.
If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.
